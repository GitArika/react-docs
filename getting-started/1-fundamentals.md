## Web Rendering Patterns

### SPA - Single Page Application

SPA or Single Page Application means that the server is not responsible to generate HTML, CSS or Javascript that is ready to use. The code runs at client side and the render occurs at client side. Usually it's used to integrate a single frontend app with multiple servers using common data structures such as JSON. Meaning that the server could be uncouples increasing performance and maintance. 


### SSR - Server Side Rendering

SSR or Server Side Rendering means that the server is responsible to run all code including database searchs, webserver requests and renders the page before delivery the HTML, CSS and JS that comes ready to be used by the client. Usually that's the most used pattern in legacy webapps. Since the server always respond an webpage ready to be used, it allows you to implement search engine optimization and better indexing in search engines such as google.
